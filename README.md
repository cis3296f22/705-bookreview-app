* To change or update a book you will change 'Get' to 'Put' and the URL to (the id will be the id that you can see in the lower body of the last step): 
  ```
  localhost:8080/update/[id]
  ```

  ```

* To check to see that it worked you can change 'Delete' to 'Get' and URL to:
  ```
  localhost:8080/books
  ```
* If you only had one book it should be empty, in the example there were 2 books, so only the 2nd book remains.
